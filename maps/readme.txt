The basic idea is that I have taken about 160 screen shots of different views of the Etnopedia maps.
These are at varying zoom levels as needed to have labels show on regions.
One approach to providing people with maps to use is just to make a folder of maps they could have on their phones.
The "Mexico map grid.jpg" serves as an index to the maps.
Each individual map is labeled to indicate roughly where it falls in the grid.

It is possible that these maps would work to include on the language pages in the app.
Scott, could you experimnet with sticking a few of these in to see how it works.
You would need to open a map and see which languages that map shows and then include that map on those pages.
This would take a lot of work, and we need to see how readable the maps are.

We would probably need to include an explanation somewhere about where the maps come from and suggest that if you have internet access, you might be best served by going to the website, but that the map shots are included for use when you are off-line.
