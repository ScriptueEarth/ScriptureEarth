 # Requirements

 -- PHP 5.2 (http://www.php.net)
 -- reCAPTCHA API Key (http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha)
 
 Installation:

	Step 1 - First, you will need to signup for reCAPTCHA API key if you plan on
	         using this feature. This will greatly reduce spam being submitted
				to your contact form. If you wish to bypass this feature, leave the
				API settings blank in inc/config.inc.
				
	Step 2 - Edit inc/config.inc to reflect additional settings such as defining
	         custom emails for selection in the form. This allows you to send
				emails to different divisions of your organization.

	Step 3 - Upload the script files to your server.

 To modify the appearance of the contact form edit "inc/contact.php". Just be
 careful not to destroy any PHP scripting while doing so.
